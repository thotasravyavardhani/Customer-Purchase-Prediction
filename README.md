# Customer-Purchase-Prediction
Customer Purchase prediction -- Machine learning Project
 
 Using 4 models:
  1. Logistic regression
  2. KNN- K Nearest neighbors
  3. Random forest Classifier
  4. Decision Tree Classifier

Steps to create a ML model:

1. import library
2. import data
3. Select X and Y (Dependent or o/p variable(Y) and Independent or i/p
   variable(X)).
4. Train Test Split: Splitting the data into Train data and Test data Train data is used to Train the ML model and test data is used to by taking random samples from dataset.
5. Select model : based on Y- o/p variable type
   if y = Continuous data - Regression models
   if y = Categorical data (0 / 1,T/ F)- Classification models
  
  Regression models:

    a. if y depends only on one of the other Variable (x)
      then eq-> y=mx+c
    b. if y depends on multiple then eq-> y=b0+b1x1+b2x2+....
    use LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL Not only these their can be many other chance

  Classification models:
   .Clustering, Naive Buyes....
6. Training or fitting the model
7. Testing or predicting the model
8. Accuracy check
